# APT Mirror

This role was tried and considered as not applicable, because in the
result, all-in-one image size will be more than 200 GB and its build
time will take at least two hours more.

The role purpose and idea were simple: create local APT mirrors on
all-in-one machine and use these local mirrors to install packages
on base CIS compliant machines.

Keeping it here just in case: commons sense and reality not always
the same, so in case of the need it will be possible to rollback.
